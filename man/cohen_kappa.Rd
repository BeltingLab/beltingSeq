\title{Calculate Cohen's Kappa coefficient between gene sets}
\usage{
cohen_kappa(.list)
}
\arguments{
\item{.list}{Named list of character vectors, each containing gene identifiers}
}
\value{
Symmetric matrix of Kappa coefficients
}
\description{
Computes pairwise Cohen's Kappa coefficient to measure similarity
between gene sets based on their overlapping genes
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
gene_sets <- list(
  set1 = c("gene1", "gene2", "gene3"),
  set2 = c("gene2", "gene3", "gene4"),
  set3 = c("gene5", "gene6", "gene7")
)
similarity <- cohen_kappa(gene_sets)
}
